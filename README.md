# Form Validation Project

This project is a simple form validation application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The purpose of this application is to validate user input in a web form and provide feedback to the user in case of any errors or incorrect entries.

## Features

- Input Validation: The application validates various form inputs such as text fields, email addresses, passwords, and numeric fields to ensure that the entered data is in the correct format.
- Real-time Feedback: The validation process occurs in real-time, providing immediate feedback to the user as they interact with the form. Errors are displayed dynamically, indicating the specific field and type of error.
- Submit Validation: Upon form submission, all fields are validated once again to ensure data integrity before the form is processed or submitted to a server.
- Error Messaging: In case of validation errors, clear and concise error messages are displayed next to the respective fields, helping the user understand and correct their inputs easily.
- Styling: The form is styled using CSS to enhance the user experience, making it visually appealing and intuitive.
